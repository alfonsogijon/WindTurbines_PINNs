# WindTurbines_PINNs

This repository includes Python notebooks to build and train deep-learning models for prediction of the power generated by wind turbines, using data from ‘La Haute Borne’ wind farm (https://opendata-renewables.engie.com/). The original dataset was pre-processed to remove non-physical and failure data points, and a reduced dataset with the necessary variables is available at the _/Dataset_ directory.

Regression models for the power coefficient, mechanical torque and generated power, receiving wind speed, pitch angle and wind velocity as inputs, are available within the _Models_ folder. The _Scripts_ directory contains notebooks implementing standard artificial neural networks, physics-informed neural networks  to predict the target magnitudes and evidential layers for uncertainty quantification.
