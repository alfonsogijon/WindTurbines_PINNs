# WindTurbines_PINNs

This repository includes Python notebooks to build and train neural-networks models for the power generated by wind turbines, using data from ‘La Haute Borne’ wind farm (https://opendata-renewables.engie.com/). 

All the calculations can be reproduced from the pre-processed datased at the _/Dataset_ directory
